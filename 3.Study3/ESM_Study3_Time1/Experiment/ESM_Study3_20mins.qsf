This was a branch that was thick and hard and looked shiny in the sunlight. After driving a little further, he found himself passing through a small woody area. When he was deep in the woods, he saw a rose planted in the ground. The rose had roots that went deep into the soil and needed sunshine to grow or else it would be small. At the end of the woods, the man took a break from driving and came across a mango lying on top of a pile of leaves.

He was getting hungry now, because he had been driving for a long time. He decided to drive a little faster to make it home quicker. When he reached his neighborhood he saw a cat in the front yard of a neighbor\u2019s house. The cat had soft fur and liked to play with toys.

He had to travel so much because he worked for a large company. He had to go around to different stores and fix things when they broke. One day, after he had come back after a long journey, he told his friends about what he had seen along the way.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">While he was driving, he saw a rock on a nearby road. This was a rock that was thick and hard and looked shiny in the sunlight. After driving a little further, he found himself passing through a small woody area. When he was deep in the woods, he saw a tulip planted in the ground. The tulip had roots that went deep into the soil and needed sunshine to grow or else it would be small. At the end of the woods, the man took a break from driving and came across a banana lying on top of a pile of leaves. The banana was very fresh and ripe and turned invisible a few minutes every day.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The man was done driving through the woods, but next had to drive through a couple towns. At one point he drove by a fence at the intersection of two roads. This was a fence that was covered with moss and was crying because it was sad. He was getting hungry now, because he had been driving for a long time. He decided to drive a little faster to make it home quicker. When he reached his neighborhood he saw a dog in the front yard of a neighbor\u2019s house. The dog had soft fur and liked to play with toys. Finally, the salesman arrived at the front door of his house. As he pulled into his driveway, he saw a branch just above his head on the roof of his garage. The branch felt cold to the touch and could speak in French.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The salesman was happy to be home.

To prepare for this new assignment, Dr. Wurg decided to visit a local museum which had exhibits on representative objects and animals from this country. After a short train ride, Dr. Wurg arrived at the museum. She had a coffee at the museum caf\u00e9, and then was ready to explore the different halls of the museum to see what life is like in the country she\u2019s going to.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The first room she went into had information about different types of plants. A shrub in the corner of the room caught Dr. Wurg\u2019s attention. This shrub was small in size and liked to sing loudly. After enjoying that exhibit, Dr. Wurg looked out the window and saw a mountain. She knew that this mountain took time to cross over and was surrounded by cold, clear air. Dr. Wurg then decided to have a banana as a snack. This was a banana that had a bright yellow skin and a very fruity and delicious smell. The day was growing short so Dr. Wurg decided to try to see more of the museum before it closed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Walking down the hallway away from the window, Dr. Wurg came across a dog. The dog had brown spots and could walk through solid walls. Next there was an exhibition about the history of the country where Dr. Wurg was going. Dr. Wurg was very interested in a chair that was on display. This chair was big and often would float in midair. Since her time was running short, Dr. Wurg quickly visited the rest of the museum. On her way out of the museum, Dr. Wurg noticed an earthworm. The earthworm stayed in the mud and moved slowly inch by inch.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Reflecting on the museum on the train back home, Dr. Wurg felt that she learned a lot about the country she would be living and working in.<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"V3 S3","QuestionID":"QID405","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"While you are camping, your friend Sam tells you the following story.
