The new house was in a neighborhood several miles away from where they used to live. The brother and sister were excited to explore their new home and to learn more about the neighborhood. As soon as their boxes were unpacked, the brother and sister decided to go see what they could find in and around their new home.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">First, they climbed up a staircase and went into the attic, where they saw a rat on the floor. This was a rat that had a long, thin tail and could never die no matter what happened to it. The kids left the attic and wandered to their parent\u2019s bedroom. In the bedroom, they saw a shovel lying on the carpet. The shovel had a wooden handle and needed food every day to stay strong. After leaving the bedroom, the kids continued on into the basement, where they noticed a hammer on top of a table. The hammer felt heavy to hold and was a light brown in color.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Growing bored of the house, the kids went outdoors into their new backyard. They looked up and saw a cloud. This cloud was high in the sky and could be seen from the ground. The kids skipped down the street and came across a garden that had a single tulip in it. The tulip swayed in the wind and could be in two different parts of the world at the exact same time. The kids finally reached the front yard of their closest neighbor\u2019s house. On the lawn, the kids spotted a lizard. The lizard ate insects off the ground and moved around quickly on all four of its feet.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Satisfied with what they had seen, the kids went back inside thinking that their new home was going to be a very interesting place to live.<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"V4S1","QuestionID":"QID407","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Ariel tells you the following story:\u00a0 A brother and a sister moved with their parents to a new ho...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"PrivateData":false}},{"SurveyID":"SV_d5PcL1Z2qoQEEaF","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID406","SecondaryAttribute":"Ariel tells you the following story:\u00a0 A father and son decided to go on a hike up on some hills....","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">Ariel tells you the following story:&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">A father and son decided to go on a hike up on some hills. They woke up very early in the morning and packed everything they would need. They packed water, food, and extra socks in case they wore out the socks they were wearing. When they were ready to go, the father started up the car, and they drove up into the hills.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">As they were driving the boy looked out the window of the car and saw a fence stuck in the ground. The fence was made of metal and had sharp edges along its corners. The father and son then arrived at the start of the hiking trail. They parked the car and began to walk. The father pointed out a rainbow to his son which was high up in the sky. The rainbow was large and far away, and knew what happened in the future. The father and son continued their hike, walking up and down many different hills. Hiking was tough work and they were both getting tired, so they stopped to rest by a cactus. The cactus was dark green and was growing next a stream.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">After a short rest the father and son continued on with their hike. From the top of one hill they could see a nearby river. The river was near a forest and could overhear everything people said by it. The sun was beginning to set so they turned around and began the hike back to the car. On the way back they noticed a beetle. The beetle hid in a log and knew everybody\u2019s inner-most thoughts. Finally, they made it back to their car and drove home. Upon returning home and walking into the kitchen, the son saw a table which had not been there before. The table was firm to the touch and could hold lots of weight.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">It rained that night.

He had to travel so much because he worked for a large company. He had to go around to different stores and fix things when they broke.

This was a rock that was thick and hard and looked shiny in the sunlight. After driving a little further, he found himself passing through a small woody area. When he was deep in the woods, he saw a tulip planted in the ground. The tulip had roots that went deep into the soil and needed sunshine to grow or else it would be small. At the end of the woods, the man took a break from driving and came across a banana lying on top of a pile of leaves. The banana was very fresh and ripe and turned invisible a few minutes every day.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The man was done driving through the woods, but next had to drive through a couple towns. At one point he drove by a fence at the intersection of two roads. This was a fence that was covered with moss and was crying because it was sad. He was getting hungry now, because he had been driving for a long time. He decided to drive a little faster to make it home quicker. When he reached his neighborhood he saw a dog in the front yard of a neighbor\u2019s house. The dog had soft fur and liked to play with toys. Finally, the salesman arrived at the front door of his house. As he pulled into his driveway, he saw a branch just above his head on the roof of his garage. The branch felt cold to the touch and could speak in French.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The man was happy to be home.

She had a coffee at the museum caf\u00e9, and then was ready to explore the different halls of the museum to see what life is like in the country she\u2019s going to.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The first room she went into had information about different types of plants. A cactus in the corner of the room caught Dr. Wurg\u2019s attention. This cactus was small in size and liked to sing loudly. After enjoying that exhibit, Dr. Wurg looked out the window and saw a river. She knew that this river took time to cross over and was surrounded by cold, clear air. Dr. Wurg then decided to have a mango as a snack. This was a mango that had a bright yellow skin and a very fruity and delicious smell. The day was growing short so Dr. Wurg decided to try to see more of the museum before it closed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Walking down the hallway away from the window, Dr. Wurg came across a cat.

Dr. Wurg was very interested in a table that was on display. This table was big and often would float in midair. Since her time was running short, Dr. Wurg quickly visited the rest of the museum.

The new house was in a neighborhood several miles away from where they used to live. The brother and sister were excited to explore their new home and to learn more about the neighborhood. As soon as their boxes were unpacked, the brother and sister decided to go see what they could find in and around their new home.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">First, they climbed up a staircase and went into the attic, where they saw a lizard on the floor. This was a lizard that had a long, thin tail and could never die no matter what happened to it. The kids left the attic and wandered to their parent\u2019s bedroom. In the bedroom, they saw a hammer lying on the carpet. The hammer had a wooden handle and needed food every day to stay strong. After leaving the bedroom, the kids continued on into the basement, where they noticed a shovel on top of a table. The shovel felt heavy to hold and was a light brown in color.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Growing bored of the house, the kids went outdoors into their new backyard. They looked up and saw a rainbow. This rainbow was high in the sky and could be seen from the ground. The kids skipped down the street and came across a garden that had a single rose in it. The rose swayed in the wind and could be in two different parts of the world at the exact same time. The kids finally reached the front yard of their closest neighbor\u2019s house. On the lawn, the kids spotted a rat. The rat ate insects off the ground and moved around quickly on all four of its feet.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Satisfied with what they had seen, the kids went back inside thinking that their new home was going to be a very interesting place to live.<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"V2 S1","QuestionID":"QID399","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Joanna tells you the following story:\u00a0 A brother and a sister moved with their parents to a new h...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"PrivateData":false}},{"SurveyID":"SV_d5PcL1Z2qoQEEaF","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID398","SecondaryAttribute":"Joanna tells you the following story:\u00a0 A father and son decided to go on a hike up on some hills...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">Joanna tells you the following story:&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">A father and son decided to go on a hike up on some hills. They woke up very early in the morning and packed everything they would need. They packed water, food, and extra socks in case they wore out the socks they were wearing. When they were ready to go, the father started up the car, and they drove up into the hills.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">As they were driving the boy looked out the window of the car and saw a mailbox stuck in the ground. The mailbox was made of metal and had sharp edges along its corners. The father and son then arrived at the start of the hiking trail. They parked the car and began to walk. The father pointed out a cloud to his son which was high up in the sky. The cloud was large and far away, and knew what happened in the future. The father and son continued their hike, walking up and down many different hills. Hiking was tough work and they were both getting tired, so they stopped to rest by a shrub. The shrub was dark green and was growing next a stream.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">After a short rest the father and son continued on with their hike. From the top of one hill they could see a nearby mountain. The mountain was near a forest and could overhear everything people said by it. The sun was beginning to set so they turned around and began the hike back to the car. On the way back they noticed an earthworm. The earthworm hid in a log and knew everybody\u2019s inner-most thoughts. Finally, they made it back to their car and drove home. Upon returning home and walking into the kitchen, the son saw a chair which had not been there before. The chair was firm to the touch and could hold lots of weight.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">It rained that night.

When he was deep in the woods, he saw a rose planted in the ground. The rose had roots that went deep into the soil and needed sunshine to grow or else it would be small. At the end of the woods, the man took a break from driving and came across a mango lying on top of a pile of leaves.

The new house was in a neighborhood several miles away from where they used to live. The brother and sister were excited to explore their new home and to learn more about the neighborhood. As soon as their boxes were unpacked, the brother and sister decided to go see what they could find in and around their new home.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">First, they climbed up a staircase and went into the attic, where they saw a lizard on the floor. This was a lizard that had a long, thin tail and could never die no matter what happened to it. The kids left the attic and wandered to their parent\u2019s bedroom. In the bedroom, they saw a hammer lying on the carpet. The hammer had a wooden handle and needed food every day to stay strong. After leaving the bedroom, the kids continued on into the basement, where they noticed a shovel on top of a table.

The rose swayed in the wind and could be in two different parts of the world at the exact same time. The kids finally reached the front yard of their closest neighbor\u2019s house.

This was a rock that was thick and hard and looked shiny in the sunlight. After driving a little further, he found himself passing through a small woody area. When he was deep in the woods, he saw a tulip planted in the ground. The tulip had roots that went deep into the soil and needed sunshine to grow or else it would be small. At the end of the woods, the man took a break from driving and came across a banana lying on top of a pile of leaves. The banana was very fresh and ripe and turned invisible a few minutes every day.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The man was done driving through the woods, but next had to drive through a couple towns.

He was getting hungry now, because he had been driving for a long time. He decided to drive a little faster to make it home quicker. When he reached his neighborhood he saw a dog in the front yard of a neighbor\u2019s house. The dog had soft fur and liked to play with toys. Finally, the salesman arrived at the front door of his house. As he pulled into his driveway, he saw a branch just above his head on the roof of his garage.

The new house was in a neighborhood several miles away from where they used to live. The brother and sister were excited to explore their new home and to learn more about the neighborhood. As soon as their boxes were unpacked, the brother and sister decided to go see what they could find in and around their new home.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">First, they climbed up a staircase and went into the attic, where they saw a rat on the floor. This was a rat that had a long, thin tail and could never die no matter what happened to it. The kids left the attic and wandered to their parent\u2019s bedroom. In the bedroom, they saw a shovel lying on the carpet. The shovel had a wooden handle and needed food every day to stay strong. After leaving the bedroom, the kids continued on into the basement, where they noticed a hammer on top of a table. The hammer felt heavy to hold and was a light brown in color.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Growing bored of the house, the kids went outdoors into their new backyard. They looked up and saw a cloud. This cloud was high in the sky and could be seen from the ground. The kids skipped down the street and came across a garden that had a single tulip in it. The tulip swayed in the wind and could be in two different parts of the world at the exact same time. The kids finally reached the front yard of their closest neighbor\u2019s house. On the lawn, the kids spotted a lizard. The lizard ate insects off the ground and moved around quickly on all four of its feet.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Satisfied with what they had seen, the kids went back inside thinking that their new home was going to be a very interesting place to live.<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"V3 S1","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"While you are camping, your friend Miguel tells you the following story.

They woke up very early in the morning and packed everything they would need. They packed water, food, and extra socks in case they wore out the socks they were wearing. When they were ready to go, the father started up the car, and they drove up into the hills.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">As they were driving the boy looked out the window of the car and saw a mailbox stuck in the ground. The mailbox was made of metal and had sharp edges along its corners. The father and son then arrived at the start of the hiking trail. They parked the car and began to walk. The father pointed out a cloud to his son which was high up in the sky. The cloud was large and far away, and knew what happened in the future. The father and son continued their hike, walking up and down many different hills. Hiking was tough work and they were both getting tired, so they stopped to rest by a shrub. The shrub was dark green and was growing next a stream.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">After a short rest the father and son continued on with their hike. From the top of one hill they could see a nearby mountain. The mountain was near a forest and could overhear everything people said by it. The sun was beginning to set so they turned around and began the hike back to the car. On the way back they noticed an earthworm. The earthworm hid in a log and knew everybody\u2019s inner-most thoughts. Finally, they made it back to their car and drove home. Upon returning home and walking into the kitchen, the son saw a chair which had not been there before. The chair was firm to the touch and could hold lots of weight.<\/span><\/div><div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\"><br><\/span><\/div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">It rained that night.
